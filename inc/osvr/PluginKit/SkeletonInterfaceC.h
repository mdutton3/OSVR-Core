/** @defgroup PluginKitCSkeleton Skeleton interface (base C API)
    @brief Sends notifications that skeleton reports (aka tracker reports) are
   complete. Skeleton interface is implemented as a device that exposes a
   tracker interface for each skeleton element. For each element, a separate
   tracker report will be sent with an updated pose followed by
   skeletonComplete. and the client can request a complete report of entire
   skeleton (all reported elements), as well as subsets. Note that since it
   exposes a device via multiple interfaces, you will need to "configure" both
   interfaces (Tracker and Skeleton).

    @param opts The device init options object.
    @param [out] iface An interface object you should retain with the same
    lifetime as the device token in order to send messages conforming to a
   Skeleton interface.
   @param jsonDescriptor A device descriptor json that contains skeleton spec
    @param numSensors The number of non-connected skeletons you will be
   reporting. Note that the number of skeleton sensors is not the same as number
   of skeleton elements. For example if plugin device reports two hands that
   will be 2 separate skeleton sensors because hands are not connected via
   common parent. If device can report an entire skeleton then it should only
   report one sensor.
